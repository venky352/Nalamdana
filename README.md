Creteria for Evaluation
=======================

1. Scope
--------
- Nalamdana strives for empowerment of marginalized and vulnerable individuals using innovative and entertaining methods for educating them. 
- This initiative Top to Toe tries to educate the
teenagers in the age group of 14-18. 
- Teenagers in this age group are going through several **physical and mental changes** and that makes them particularly **vulnerable** to external influences. Some of them get exposed to **alcohol or drugs**, some face **child abuse** and other evils. 
- Hence, Nalamdana tries to educate them about hygiene, sex education, safety, recognizing their potential and setting future goals.   

With this vision, they have already tried distributing smalls handbooks about these topics in schools, but have been **refused by school authorities** citing reasons such as sexual content. An online platform will enable them to overcome these restrictions. A fun and interactive platform would make the learning process interactive, and help in gaining popularity, thereby making **necessary education accessible** as well.

3. Innovation
-------------
- Presently, there is no recognized online information source catering to teenagers needs in particular. 
- All information is acquired via social networking sites, that's often unapproved and misguiding. Related web searches often leads to pornographic and explicit content.  
- The educational content Nalamdana provides has been developed with the approval of certified educators. 


4. Accessible by Target User Base
---------------------------------

With proper marketing, we want this to be a cool and fun hangout place for teenagers. To gather popularity, we have provided login via facebook for visitors. They can complete quizzes, see their ranks in the score boards, get badges of honor etc.  

5. Implementable
----------------
- Developed using the popular Drupal CMS for development. Drupal has been in active development since long, and powers several websites globally. 
- It has excellent documentation and enjoys popular support in the developer community. 
- All these features minimize the overhead of development, and any person with little exposure can learn and quickly modify the content according to his needs.

6. Open Source Software
-----------------------
We have used open source Drupal CMS and its plugins for developing the portal.
